This Unity project contains a 2D HealthBar for use in games and a Billboard script for camera tracking in 3D games.

## HealthBar

The HealthBar visually represents the character's health status. As the player's health decreases, the fill of the HealthBar decreases accordingly.

### Usage

#### Adding the HealthBar Script:
- Add the `HealthBar.cs` script file to your project.

#### Adding HealthBar to the UI Canvas:
1. Create a UI Canvas in Unity.
2. Add a Slider to the Canvas.
3. Add a Fill to the Slider's Fill Area.
4. Connect the Slider to the HealthBar script.

## Billboard Script

The Billboard script allows 3D objects to always face the camera, ensuring that they are oriented towards it at all times.

### Usage

#### Adding the Billboard Script:
- Add the `Billboard.cs` script file to your project.

#### Attaching Billboard to 3D Objects:
- Attach the Billboard script to 3D objects that need to face the camera.
